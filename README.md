## Abstract    

Schistosomiasis is a major, yet historically neglected tropical disease. Ongoing efforts aimed at eliminating schistosomiasis morbidity, disrupting transmission, and eradicating human infections have recently refocused on supplementing mass chemotherapy for humans with snail control programs. Snail control, such as mollusciciding, often varies wildly in frequency or intensity, with variable success. We used individual-based models (IBMs) based on general metabolic theory, Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, to simulate human-infectious schistosome density under a range of molluscicide scenarios varying in frequency and intensity throughout a typical 150-day transmission season. Without molluscicide control, our DEB-IBM predicts intense resource competition among snail hosts and a large parasite peak early in the season for snail populations consuming algae or detritus. Consistent monthly control, as recommended by the WHO, can work, but only if intense, i.e. > 90% host mortality rate. In contrast, one-off, intense, and early mollusciciding induces large delayed rebounds in cercariae density by releasing the few remaining snails from resource competition. Our simulations confirm the WHO recommendation that frequent mollusciciding can disrupt schistosome transmission to humans. However, they contradict recent alternatives of infrequent mollusciciding, e.g. annually, by suggesting this strategy can backfire due to a specific mechanism, namely resource competition among hosts limits parasite emergence. Our model results show how host-parasite resource ecology can identify critical parasite peaks and the potential risks of current control strategies by generating testable predictions. In the field, we suggest snail reproduction could predict impending peaks of cercariae release. Combined, we illustrate scaling individuals to populations using bioenergetics models can parse the timing and intensity of practical control strategies against human-infectious schistosomes to mediate unintended consequences for human health.
