## Abstract    

Schistosomiasis is a major, historically neglected tropical disease. Ongoing efforts aimed at reducing human infection have recently refocused on supplementing human mass chemotherapy with snail molluscicide programs. Mollusciciding often varies wildly in frequency or intensity, with variable success. We used individual-based models based on general metabolic theory, Dynamic Energy Budget theory, to simulate human-infectious schistosome density under molluscicide scenarios varying in frequency and intensity throughout a 150-day transmission season. Without molluscicide control, our model predicts intense resource competition among hosts and large and early parasite peaks under algae and detritus resources. Consistent monthly control, as recommended by the WHO, can work if intense, i.e. > 90% host mortality. In contrast, one-off, intense, and early mollusciciding induces large delayed rebounds in cercariae by releasing the few remaining snails from resource competition. Our simulations confirm the WHO recommendation that frequent mollusciciding can disrupt transmission, but contradict recent suggestions for infrequent mollusciciding, e.g. annually, which can backfire because relaxed resource competition promotes parasite production. Our results show resource ecology models can identify peaks in parasite density. More generally, resource competition among hosts may complicate efforts to control disease through culling. Considering resource ecological interactions may help managers avoid unintended consequences for human health.
